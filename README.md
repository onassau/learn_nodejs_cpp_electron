# learn_nodejs_cpp_electron
A selflearning quicky for NodeJS with Cpp backend and electron frontend

Meant as a short introduction to NodeJS and Electron, while being used to C++ development. Why not combine them to see how this could work?
Ultra-newbie style, because I grabbed some tutorials and online stuff and put some of it together.
